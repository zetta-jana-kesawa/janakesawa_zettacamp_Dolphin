        Hi, I am <span id="big">Jana Kesawa</span>, an old man participating in ZettaCamp in hopes of trying to be a better person. I entered <span>ZettaCamp in Quality Assurance (QA)</span>. It is a pleasure to meet and know you.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a graduate of <span id="big">Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember</span> in Surabaya, from what once was <span>Mathematics and Science Faculty</span>, majoring in <span>chemistry</span>. I myself am a Balinese, and I live in city of Denpasar, which is about 1 hour away of relaxed motorbike ride from ZettaHouse Bali accounting the traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite being old, I still immerse myself in gaming. I am a fan of <span id="big">Yu-Gi-Oh!</span> and currently getting that fix through <span>Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel</span> game. Other hobbies of mine include <span>reading novels</span>.
