        Minuteman is a patriotic hero. Originally an old nuclear researcher named Frank Stiles who was betrayed by his past colleague, he gained his powers from a statue of patriotic warrior that was hit by an alien energy called <strong>Energy X</strong>.
        <br>The energy transferred into his aging body, bringing it back to its youthful form, along with enhanced physical capabilities. Donning a costume to protect his identity, Minuteman protects the city's day-to-day life with his trusty weapon Patriot.
